# Job Listings

This repository contains a collection of React code components that can be used to build a job listings application. The components are well-organized and easy to use, and they are also fully tested.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the repository to your local machine. Then, install the dependencies using `npm install`. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start using the components by importing them into your React code.

The following is a list of the components that are included in this repository:

- Header
- Login (Authentication)
- Listing
- Register
- Listings
- Filter

### <b><u>Header</u></b>
The Header component is a simple header that can be used to display the name of the application. In this case it stores the search input, the navigation bars and the login authentication.

- NavBar <br>

A navbar appears at the top of our web app and contains a menu or set of links that allow users to navigate through different sections or pages of the web app.<br>

In the context of our job listing website, a navbar would serve as a navigation tool to help users easily access various sections or features of the website. Here's an example:

1. The job application website has a navbar placed at the top of every page
2. The navbar includes links used  such as "Home", "About", "Contacts", "Blog."
3. When a user visits the web app, the navbar is visible and provides a consistent navigation structure across all pages.<br>


### <b><u>Filter</u></b>

A search filter is a feature that allows users to refine and narrow down their search results based on specific criteria or requirements. <br>
In the context of a job listing application, a search filter would enable users to search for job requirements that match their preferences or qualifications.<br>

In a our Job Listing App scenario we can have te following steps;

1. On the job application website, the user navigates to the job search page and locates the search filter section.<br>
2. After selecting the desired filters, the user triggers the search.
3. The website then fetches and displays job listings that match the selected filters, showing only the job requirements relevant to software development.
4. The user can review the filtered results and explore specific job listings that match their preferences.<br><br>


### <b><u> Login Authentication </u></b>

Login authentication, in the context of a job listing web app, is a process that verifies the identity of a user before granting access to their account. It ensures that only authorized individuals, whether they are job seekers or employers, can log in and access the respective functionalities of the website.

### <b><u> Register </u></b>

 The Register component allows users to register on a job application website. It provides a form where users can enter their email, password, and select their role (employer or user). The component utilizes React hooks `{useState and useContext}` to manage the form state and interact with the application context.<br>

 The form captures the user's input and handles the form submission. When the user clicks the "Register" button, the component retrieves the entered email, password, and role from the form fields. It then creates a new user object with this information.
